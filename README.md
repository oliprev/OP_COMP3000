# **Teaching and Reinforcing Vital Cybersecurity Skills using Google Gemini**

## **Supervisor**: Professor Nathan Clarke

## **Technologies being used**: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS, Ajax

## *Project vision*
The aim of this project is to develop a solution targeted at both companies and their workforces, as well as everyday technology users who wish to enhance their cybersecurity skills. The web application is designed to address the growing issue of online vulnerabilities, which can lead to significant social, economic, and even political repercussions for organisations.
 
To tackle these risks, the proposed solution will be a full-stack web-based application (thus ensuring compatibility across various devices). It will integrate with OpenAI’s ChatGPT to provide practical, AI-driven content tailored to the users’ needs. There may also be scope for monetisation.
 
Key features of the application will consist of:
 
- *Dynamic content creation*: The AI will generate scenarios and challenges to keep users engaged and aware – with varying levels of difficulty.
- *Text-based lessons*: There will be a portion of the application dedicated to teaching about different cybersecurity principles – which will be updated regularly to maintain relevance.
- *Phishing email simulations*: Users will have emails generated for them to practise identifying signs of phishing – with varying levels of difficulty.
- *Achievements and statistics*: Users can track their progress through achievements and detailed statistics – with incentives for daily use.
- *Administrative review*: Organisations will have the ability to review user performance of employees to visualise overall improvement.
 
This project seeks to deliver a challenging, yet engaging educational platform that not only sharpens cybersecurity skills but also offers companies and individuals a way to monitor and improve their overall online security toolkit.
